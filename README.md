# vim-atomified
A special dark, not stupid-looking Vim colorscheme. Slightly inspired by Atom.

If you have any suggestions like support for specific languages or gui elements, just open an issue and I'll do what I can (and like to (: ).

## Notes
You may want to `:set termguicolors` for some terminal's full color support.
